# tourism-site

## Details
- Task B: Web Development Tourism Website: Galway City
- Name: Eldar Sieitablaiev

## Differences from Design Plan
- In initial requirements, the project was described as Airbnb, but then I find out that it has to be a more simple tourism website with information about a city.
- That's why, was added link Home, Attractions, Local Cuisine, Contact Us, Events relevant pages for them and implemented all tech requirements relevant to project. 

- Interactive Features Implemented:
  - Email client popup and create new letter with the addressee field filled in, when we click on link (send us an email) on Page Contact Us.
  - If you incorrect field form and try to submit, will show you an error describe you about problem below submit button on Page Contact Us.
  - If you hover your mouse over the logo, it will change its position on all Pages.
  - You can control video play stop and other interactive with video on Home page.
- Animations Implemented: on logo (logo rotating on time after page reloaded) on all Pages
- HTML 5 feature/s used:
  1. Semantic tags on all Pages;
  2. Form on Contact Us page;
  3. Audio/Video on Home page;
  4. SVG on all pages in Header Logo;
  5. Animation on all pages in Header Logo;
  6. Transition on all pages in Header Logo;

- Ideas for further development:
    - Move video to cloud storage and put link to video tag.
    - Make page details of attractions, and links on this page for each item at the attractions.
    - Todo gallery of photos and use it for example on details of sight
